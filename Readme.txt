# Logic Tag Writer

**Logic Tag Writer** is a multithreaded semantic tagging tool designed for large-scale text file processing. It uses SHA256 hashing for deduplication, OpenAI GPT integration for context-aware tagging, and threaded I/O for high-throughput analysis. Developed for use in threat intelligence pipelines, knowledge base classification, and AI model training prep.

This tool scans directories, hashes text files, and generates `.tag.txt` metadata files based on the fileâ€™s content and structure. Each tag file includes semantically rich context and is saved alongside the original source.

## Features

- Multithreaded directory traversal and file processing
- SHA256-based file fingerprinting and cache deduplication
- Automatic `.tag.txt` file creation alongside source files
- Caching and manifest tracking to prevent reprocessing
- Modular design for easy adaptation to other LLMs or prompt engines
